# LaTeX Ã— TU Delft - Article Template

This template aimed to simplify and improve the template provided in the course AE2333-I. Though it might still be useful for that course, the template is now intended to be a simple and extensive article template, based on the official AIAA template. The following three main design principles apply:

- **Simplicity First:** An organised class file with an option to switch to two columns easily;
- **Effortless:** A careful selection of common packages to get started immediately;
- **Complete:** Ready-to-go when it comes to the structure + An extensive sample bibliography.

This template is created for _pdfLaTeX_, but it is also compatible with _XeLaTeX_ or _LuaLaTeX_. _Natbib_ is used for the bibliography with as backend _BibTeX_. Please visit https://dzwaneveld.github.io/article/ for the full documentation.
