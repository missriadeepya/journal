% The examples below illustrate different reference types, following AIAA style (but, as said before, you are free to choose another output style). Private communications and personal web sites should appear as footnotes rather than in the reference list. Papers that have not been published should be cited as “unpublished”; papers that have been submitted or accepted for publication should be cited as “submitted for publication.”

% The DOI (Digital Object Identifier) should be incorporated in every reference for which it is available (see Ref. 1 sample); for more information on DOIs, visit www.doi.org or www.crossref.org.

%%%%% Periodical %%%%%

% All of the preceding information is required. The journal issue number (“No. 11” in Ref. 1) is preferred, but the month (Nov.) can be substituted if the issue number is not available. Use the complete date for daily and weekly publications. Transactions follow the same style as other journals.

%%%%% Books %%%%%

% Publisher, place, and date of publication are required for all books. No state or country is required for major cities: New York, London, Moscow, etc. A differentiation must always be made between Cambridge, MA, and Cambridge, England, UK. Note that series titles are in Roman type.

%%%%% Reports, Theses, and Individual Papers %%%%%

% Government agency reports do not require locations. For reports such as NASA TM-85940, neither insert nor delete dashes; leave them as provided. Place of publication should be given, although it is not mandatory, for military and company reports. Always include a city and state for universities. Papers need only the name of the sponsor; neither the sponsor’s location nor the conference name and location is required. Do not confuse proceedings references with conference papers.
